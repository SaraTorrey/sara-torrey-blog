        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <p class="quote">
            After the birth of my first son in 2016 I decided to give coding a try. My husband had been encouraging me to do so for a while and I finally thought, "why not?" I took a few courses and learned HTML. I liked the language, because it made sense to me and it seemed like there was a simple logic behind it. It is the skeleton of the page, and it controls the basic functionality of the text. However, I did not realize the power of HTML until I revisited it about two years later after the birth of my second son.

            This time around due to several factors I decided to pursue coding much more seriously. I had not touched it since 2016 and now in 2018 I was coming back to it. Thankfully the material had stayed with me for the most part, but taking courses through Free Code Camp and Cole Steele's Udemy material took me to a new level. I realized that in HTML there are many areas that I had not paid too much attention to when I learned the subject the first time.

            For instance, the use of the button, anchor, span, tables, amongst many others were unclear to me. I became much more comfortable with these tools as I did small projects, like making a Tic Tac Toe board, creating a landing page, making a photo gallery page, and making a static blog page.

            A few days ago someone asked on Twitter how to improve her HTML. I think by creating static pages you can practice a lot of HTML and CSS. I have made a small video to demonstrate some of the HTML highlights.
